# GEHC Watch App
My solution for GEHC Technical test.  
Implemented in vanilla Typescript.  
[Live link](https://gehc.dhia.dev/)

### Implemented functionalities
- ~~Part A~~Â  (Done)
    - Watch logic / View
    - Mode / Increase / Light buttons
- ~~Part B~~ (Done)
    - Dynamic creation of watches with timezones
    - Multiple watches view
    - Time format toggling (24h / 12h)

### Implementation walkthrough
Design patterns used: MVC, State, Observer, Command, Singleton.
- Overall architecture follows the MVC model. 
- The model is a Singleton to allow for a single source of truth.
- The model also is a Subject in the Observer design pattern, whereas the View is an observer, in order to be notified of data changes.
- The model utilizes the State design pattern in order to alter "increase" behavior depending on the Watch mode.
- View presents the data on a webpage and captures user events, calls for the controller, which in turn updates the model, which updates the view through the Observer pattern.
- The reset all functionality functions through a partial implementation of the Command pattern (partial meaning only the Increase function is implemented), where all the increase commands are stored in the model, and when a "reset" event is triggered, the commands are looped through and undone one at a time.

### Possible improvements
- **Multiple views**: one for the web and one for the console. Could be implemented using *Factory* design pattern.
    - Technically we could also refactor the watch creation logic using Factory but I've decided against the adding extra complexity given that the implementation doesn't need it. (The only difference between watches is the timezone attribute).
- **Undo/Redo**: through a more general implementation of the *Command* design pattern.
    - Since it's not part of the requirements, the implementation of the Command pattern has been limited only to the "reset" functionality.
- Unit testing
